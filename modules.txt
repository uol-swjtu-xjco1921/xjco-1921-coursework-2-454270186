My project has these modules:
1. main (the entry of project)
2. errhandler
3. fileio 
4. script
5. vector
6. hashtable
7. drawer
8. plot_data.sh
--------------------------------

1. main
This is the entry file of project. In this file, 
it initializes three data structures to store bounding, 
edges and nodes. Then it reads the data file and parse 
the datas. After data parsing, it writes formatted data
into the files that are for Gnuplot to draw the routes.
Then, it call system() to execute shell script to start
Gnuplot and generate the 'map.png'. Finally, it releases
the resources.

2. errhandler
This module includes error-handler and format-check.
